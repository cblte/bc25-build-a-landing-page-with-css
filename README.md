# Bootcamp 2025 - Practice: build a landing page with CSS

## Plan

1. Then we'll start with the home page of the website by adding the hero section, which describes the thing the site provides, and a “call to action” button
2. We'll add a logo and a top menu that points to some pages we'll work on next, like pricing, sign up, login.
3. We'll add a footer with the copyright, contact information and other links.
4. We'll work on adding more things to the home page, like the main features.
5. We'll make the page responsive, which means adapting to small and large screens.
6. We'll work on a pricing page, where people can see the monthly or yearly prices to get access to the product or service.
7. We'll add a blog/updates page, where users can see the latest company news or product updates.
